v1.0 -  15/03/22  -  Made in Unity 2019.4.31f1 / SDK3-2022.02.16.19.13 / UdonSharp_v0.20.3

(Prefab Functionality)
Drop solution for making players correctly follow moving Platforms / Vehicles / GameObjects in your scene when standing on them. Makes players "Functionally" behave as if they were parented to any GameObject they stand on. Behavior can be enabled or disabled based on layers.

(Usage)
Set your moving objects/platforms to layer 11(Environment) or a custom layer and assign layers in the layer mask.

You only need one of these prefabs in your scene. Do not add more than one.

(Additional)

Won't work with CyanEmu as it doesn't support player origin tracking so you will need to verify behavior in game.
